# useColor

The useColor hook can be used in a component to get the raw representation of a theme color.
This can be useful when you want to derive another color from a 3rd party library like polished.

For example, let's make a Button with a lighter version of "primary" color.

<Preview>
  <ButtonColor />
</Preview>

```
import { lighten } from 'polished';
import { useColor, Button } from 'stylestrap';

function LightButtonView() {
  const color = useColor("danger");
  const lightenedColor = lighten(0.3, color);

  return <Button color={lightenedColor}>Light Button</Button>;
}
```

It's a common requirement in any website to get a lightened or darkened variant
of a theme color. Since it can be cumbersome to use a 3rd party library explicitly,
the useColor hook supports a second argument for changing the color shade based on
preset values.

Pass in a value from -7 to +7 to get the variants.

<Preview>
  <ButtonColorVariants />
</Preview>

```
function ColorVariantExample() {
  const colorVariant = useColor("danger", -3);

  return <ColorBox color={lightenedColor}>Dark 3</ColorBox>;
}
```

<InfoCard>
  The enum passed to get the preset color variants defaults to integers from -7 to +7.
  However, this can be easily changed to more meaningful keywords such as "light", "lighter" and "lightest"
  by adding aliases to the colorShadeMap in the theme. However the original references need to remain
  as some of the core functions of stylestrap depend on the original enums.
