## FormInput
`FormInput` is a compound component made of many components like `FormGroup`, `Input`, `Label` and `HelpText`.

  <Presets.FormInputPreset />

```jsx
<FormInput
  type="email"
  placeholder="name@example.com"
  label="Email address"
  helpText="We'll never share your email with anyone else."
/>
```

Validation feedback is baked into the Presets. We can activate them by passing `error`, `touched` and `validInfo`
props.

In the following example, we validate the email address by simply checking whether it has an `@` sign.
In a real world application, you would use a library like `yup` to do validations in forms.

The purpose of the `touched` prop is to validate the fields only if it was touched by the user. In this example,
we pass `touched` as true when there is an error. This can be handled more meaningfully with the help of a library
like formik.

Also note that the `vaidInfo` prop is not very useful in practice. If the fields are valid, you would usually
want to submit the form right away, rather than indicating that the form values are valid.
