# Grid
### An alternative to the classic Bootstrap flex layout, built with the CSS Grid.

The Grid component can be used to create advanced layouts spanning across the 2D
space, based on both Rows and Columns.

## Column Based Layout

One of the primitive requirement of any website is a column based layout.

Let's create a 3 column layout, with 6 items. Note that we are
using the colors interchangeably to make the distinction among the boxes.

<Preview>
  <Grid columns="3">
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
  </Grid>
</Preview>

```typescript jsx
<Grid columns="3">
  <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
  <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
  <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
</Grid>
```

A common requirement is to add an equal amount of gaps among the
grid children. This can be achieved by specifying the `gap` prop.

<Preview>
  <Grid columns="3" gap="0.5rem">
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
  </Grid>
</Preview>

```typescript jsx
<Grid columns="3" gap="1rem">
  <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  {/* ... */}
</Grid>
```

## Uneven columns
Suppose that we want to create a two-column layout where the first
column is twice as wide as the second one.

There are two ways to do this with the Grid component.

### 1. By using uneven columns explicitly
Since the Grid is made up of the CSS grid, we can use `fr` units to
create columns as fractions of the full width.

<Preview>
  <Grid columns="2fr 1fr" gap="0.5rem">
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  </Grid>
</Preview>

```typescript jsx
<Grid columns="2fr 1fr" gap="1rem">
  <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  {/* ... */}
</Grid>
```

Using this notation, similarly, we can create a three-column layout such that,
* the first column has a fixed width of 50px,
* and the other two columns equally occupy the remaining width.

<Preview>
  <Grid columns="50px 1fr 1fr" gap="0.5rem">
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  </Grid>
</Preview>

```typescript jsx
<Grid columns="50px 1fr 1fr" gap="1rem">
  <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  {/* ... */}
</Grid>
```

> The Grid component internally uses the `grid-template-columns` attribute of the
CSS Grid layout to achieve this behavior. You can view the complete reference of the `grid-template-columns`
attribute from the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns)

### 2. Using the Cell component
The Grid Component is made of the [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout),
and therefore, the children behave as [Grid Cells](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Grid_cell).
Since the CSS Grid is a 2D layout, we can place a Cell anywhere on the grid using css properties.

To make this easier, stylestrap exports a `Cell` component. We can specify the start and end
tracks using the `col` prop. Let's configure the first cell to start from the 1st track and end
on the 3rd track.

<Preview>
  <Grid columns="3" gap="0.5rem">
    <Cell as={ColoredDiv} col={[1, 3]} color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="#ddd" css={{ display: 'flex',  justifyContent: 'space-between', height: 'initial' }}>
      <span>⇦1</span>
      <span>2⇨</span>
    </ColoredDiv>
    <ColoredDiv color="#ddd" css={{ display: 'flex',  justifyContent: 'space-between', height: 'initial' }}>
      <span>⇦2</span>
      <span>3⇨</span>
    </ColoredDiv>
    <ColoredDiv color="#ddd" css={{ display: 'flex',  justifyContent: 'space-between', height: 'initial' }}>
      <span>⇦3</span>
      <span>4⇨</span>
    </ColoredDiv>
  </Grid>
</Preview>

```typescript jsx
<Grid columns="3" gap="1rem">
  <Cell col={[1, 3]}>
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  </Cell>
  <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
</Grid>
```
The markup can be further simplified using the Styled Components' `as` prop.

```typescript jsx
<Grid columns="3" gap="1rem">
  <Cell as={ColoredDiv} col={[1, 3]} color="info" />
  <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
</Grid>
```
