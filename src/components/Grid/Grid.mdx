# Grid
### An alternative to the classic Bootstrap flex layout, built with the CSS Grid.

The Grid component can be used to create advanced layouts spanning across the 2D
space, based on both Rows and Columns.

## Column Based Layout

One of the primitive requirement of any website is a column based layout.

Let's create a 3 column layout, with 6 items. Note that we are
using the colors interchangeably to make the distinction among the boxes.

<Preview>
  <Grid columns="3">
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
  </Grid>
</Preview>

```typescript jsx
<Grid columns="3">
  <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
  <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
  <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
</Grid>
```
If we were to achieve the same behavior using the classic Bootstrap Row-Col
layout, we would need to write almost double the markup.

## Gaps

A common requirement is to add an equal amount of gaps among the
grid children. This can be achieved by specifying the `gap` prop.

<Preview>
  <Grid columns="3" gap="0.5rem">
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
  </Grid>
</Preview>

```typescript jsx
<Grid columns="3" gap="1rem">
  <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  {/* ... */}
</Grid>
```

The `gap` prop can be a string with two values separated by a space,
to specify the horizontal & vertical gaps respectively.

<Preview>
  <Grid columns="3" gap="0.5rem 2rem">
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
  </Grid>
</Preview>

```typescript jsx
<Grid columns="3" gap="0.5rem 2rem">
  <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  {/* ... */}
</Grid>
```

## Advanced Usage
The Stylestrap Grid Component is made using the [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout),

We can think of the Grid as made up of grid lines. In a n-line grid, The vertical lines are numbered
from **1 to n** starting from left, or from **-1 to -n** starting from the right.
Similarly, the horizontal lines are numbered from **1 to m** and **-1 to -m** respectively.

This is an important concept to be remembered when working with the stylestrap Grid component.
Most of the advanced usages of the Grid are based on these numbers.

## Uneven column widths
Suppose that we want to create a two-column layout where the first
column is twice as wide as the second one.

There are two ways to do this with the Grid component.

### 1. By using uneven columns explicitly
Since the Grid is made up of the CSS grid, we can use `fr` units to
create columns as fractions of the full width.

<Preview>
  <Grid columns="2fr 1fr" gap="0.5rem">
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  </Grid>
</Preview>

```typescript jsx
<Grid columns="2fr 1fr" gap="1rem">
  <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  {/* ... */}
</Grid>
```

Using this notation, similarly, we can create a three-column layout such that,
* the first column has a fixed width of 50px,
* and the other two columns equally occupy the remaining width.

<Preview>
  <Grid columns="50px 1fr 1fr" gap="0.5rem">
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  </Grid>
</Preview>

```typescript jsx
<Grid columns="50px 1fr 1fr" gap="1rem">
  <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  {/* ... */}
</Grid>
```

> The Grid component internally uses the `grid-template-columns` attribute of the
CSS Grid layout to achieve this behavior. You can view the complete reference of the `grid-template-columns`
attribute from the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns)

### 2. Using the Cell component
Another way to achieve uneven width columns is by making a child component
span across multiple cells. This is achieved by setting the start and end grid lines.

To do this, the target child element should be wrapped by the `Cell` component.
Then the left and right grid lines can be specified by passing the `left` and `right` props respectively.

<Preview>
  <Grid columns="3" gap="0.5rem">
    <Cell as={ColoredDiv} left={1} right={3} color="info" />
    <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
  </Grid>
</Preview>

```typescript jsx
<Grid columns="3" gap="1rem">
  <Cell left={1} right={3}>
    <ColoredDiv color="info" />
  </Cell>
  <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
</Grid>
```

The markup can be further simplified using the Styled Components' `as` prop.

```typescript jsx
<Grid columns="3" gap="1rem">
  <Cell as={ColoredDiv}  left={1} right={3} color="info" />
  <ColoredDiv color="dark" />
</Grid>
```

## Grid line props
As explained in the example above, grid line props (`left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`)
can be used to make a cell span across a target area in the grid.

When one value of a pair is omitted, it will be defaulted to the adjacent line. eg:
* left = 2, right not specified => Cell spans from line 2 to 3.
* left not specified, right = 2 => Cell spans from line 1 to 2.

Same behavior can be seen for top and bottom props.

## 2D Layout
Suppose we want to create a 5 x 5 grid, and color the corner cells.

<Preview>
  <Grid rows="5" columns="5" gap="xs">
    <Cell as={ColoredDiv} color="primary" left={1} top={1} />
    <Cell as={ColoredDiv} color="success" right={-1} top={1} />
    <Cell as={ColoredDiv} color="warning" left={1} bottom={-1} />
    <Cell as={ColoredDiv} color="danger" right={-1} bottom={-1} />
    { Array((5*5) - 4).fill().map((v, i) => <Cell key={i} as={ColoredDiv} color="#eee" height="50px" />) }
  </Grid>
</Preview>

The way you would do this in a flex based layout is usually using the `justifyContent` and `alignItems`
CSS attributes. However with the Grid component, it's rather trivial. We just need to specify
the row and column for each cell.

```typescript jsx
<Grid rows="5" columns="5" gap="xs">
  <Cell as={ColoredDiv} color="primary" left={1} top={1} />
  <Cell as={ColoredDiv} color="success" right={-1} top={1} />
  <Cell as={ColoredDiv} color="warning" left={1} bottom={-1} />
  <Cell as={ColoredDiv} color="danger" right={-1} bottom={-1} />
  {/* empty cells are filled to show the tracks in above example */}
</Grid>
```
Now suppose we want to move the red box to fill 3rd and 4th cells.
<Preview>
  <Grid rows="5" columns="5" gap="xs">
    <Cell as={ColoredDiv} color="primary" left={1} top={1} />
    <Cell as={ColoredDiv} color="success" right={-1} top={1} />
    <Cell as={ColoredDiv} color="warning" left={1} bottom={-1} />
    <Cell as={ColoredDiv} color="danger" left={-4} right={-2} bottom={-1} />
    { Array((5*5) - 4 - 1).fill().map((v, i) => <Cell key={i} as={ColoredDiv} color="#eee" height="50px" />) }
  </Grid>
</Preview>

It would be a nightmare with a flex based layout. But with the Grid, it's
only a prop change.

```typescript jsx
<Grid rows="5" columns="5" gap="xs">
  {/* Unchanged markup */}
  <Cell as={ColoredDiv} color="danger" left={3} right={5} bottom={-1} />
</Grid>
```

## Template Areas
Grid-line props does make our life easier. But it can still be a pain to do a complex
layout counting rows and columns. Thus, the Grid supports a way to _sort of_ draw the
layout with letters or words.

< WordTemplate />

Using this template, we can create a layout as follows.

<Preview>
  <GridArea />
</Preview>

The idea here is to pass the areas template to the Grid component using the `areas` prop,
and then refer to each of those areas using the `area` prop of the Cell component.

```typescript jsx
const areasTemplate = `
  "HEAD HEAD"
  "SIDE BODY"
  "SIDE FOOT"
`;
// ...
<Grid columns="1fr 4fr" rows="1fr 3fr 1fr" height="200px" gap="xs" areas={areasTemplate}>
  <Cell area="HEAD">HEAD</Cell>
  <Cell area="SIDE">SIDE</Cell>
  <Cell area="BODY">BODY</Cell>
  <Cell area="FOOT">FOOT</Cell>
</Grid>
```
